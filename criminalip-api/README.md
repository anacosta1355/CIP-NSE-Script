### Install
- - -

Copy the criminalip-api.nse script to your Nmap Script folder.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/criminalip/CIP-Nse-Script.git
$ cp criminalip-api.nse NMAP_Script_HOME(ex: /usr/share/nmap/scripts/)
```
<br/>

### Usage
- - -

Please follow these two steps before using this service.

1. Create an API Key by signing up for [Criminal IP](https://www.criminalip.io/ko)

2. You can enter your API key into the script file so that you donâ€™t have to enter the API Key every time. (Optional)

```
-- Set your Criminal IP API key here to avoid typing it in every time:
local apiKey = ""
```

The example below shows the results of searching for IP through script file. You can find various information such as risk score, country information, as_name for specific IP addresses.
```
$  nmap --script criminalip-api --script-args 'criminalip-api.target= target IP, apikey=Your x-api-key'
$  nmap --script criminalip-api --script-args 'criminalip-api.target= target IP' # when you set your api-key on script
